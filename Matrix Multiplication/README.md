Multiplying Matrices

Max Matrix size atm is 10x10
This is a simply and messy C program to multiply Matrices.
The current version relies comepletely on there being command line arguments to run.
I'll fix it when I get time.

Running without any command line arguments won't destroy anything. Just wastes your time.
Template testing files have been added to view file layout
Reading properly relies on the first line of the file providing ### of rows and columns in that order. FOllowed by said Matrix.
